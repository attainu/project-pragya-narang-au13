In this project I used library- pygame and tkinter. I made the project on Jupyter Notebook.

Pygame:-  It is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library. This allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in the python language.
Installation of pygame command is:-
pip install pygame

Tkinter:- It is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk.
Tkinter is not the only GuiProgramming toolkit for Python.
